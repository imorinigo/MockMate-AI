Preparing for job interviews requires more than
domain knowledge—it demands strong com-
munication skills and confident nonverbal pre-
sentation. In this work, we present MockMate,
a web-based interview training platform that
integrates large language models (LLMs), com-
puter vision, and speech processing to simulate
real-world interviews and provide automated
feedback. Users upload a résumé and job de-
scription, select interview settings, and respond
to dynamically generated questions while being
recorded. Our system analyzes both verbal and
nonverbal performance using OpenCV for fa-
cial behavior tracking and Whisper for speech
transcription.
